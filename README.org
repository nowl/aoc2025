* Advent of Code 2025
Another fun year of [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]]!

Choosing Rust again this year. Also trying a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar][PEG parser]] for Rust [[https://pest.rs/]]

Run a day by bin
#+begin_src bash
cargo run --release --bin day1p1 < /data/day1
#+end_src

or using [[https://github.com/casey/just][Just]]
#+begin_src bash
just run day1p1 day1
just run-release day1p1 day1
#+end_src
